# Simple react boilerplate 

## Contribute

To get a reloadable env, with boilerplate component, clone this project and

```shell
yarn install
yarn start
```

Next, we'll start the debugger and run it locally.

Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:8000) in any browser and launch Firefox or Chrome. You should now be able to select a tab to debug.

__Why Yarn and not NPM?__

We like [Yarn]() because it makes sure everyone is using the same library versions.
